# iAnatomist
---
iAnatomist is a cognitively inspired anatomical expert system for automated anatomical structure recognition in large-scale biomedical imaging data, designed to enable robust and interpretable cross-modal anatomical inference.


## iAnatomist Software
---
We provide precompiled Windows binaries in the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/Brainsmatics/iAnatomist/releases/tag/softaware_exe) section. After downloading the software package, users can launch the desktop application by running main.exe.
The application supports interactive visualization of 3D whole-mouse-brain images, anatomical orientation alignment, automated brain structure recognition, and user-guided correction of anatomical labels. Please refer to the [tutorial]() before using the software.
